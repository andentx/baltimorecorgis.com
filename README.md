## Description

This is the website for Baltimore Corgis, a community of Corgis, owners, and friends!
<br />
<br />
After starting with a Facebook page, then a drag-and-drop website builder, the organizer of Baltimore Corgis decided to move to a more customized and performant solution for their website.
<br />
<br />
In February 2023, I built the first version of the new Baltimore Corgis website, using the existing/previous website's design. While implementing the existing features into a custom solution, I made the following improvements:

<br />

- Set up Sanity CMS to store and easily edit content like events, members, etc.
- Reduced page loading time by 75%
- Fine-tuned responsive resizing
- Improved accessibility
- Implemented custom fonts
- Made it easier to add changed or third-party integrations in the future

<br />

### February 2025 Update:

Two years later, I rebuilt the website with a new tech stack to enhance performance, maintainability, and future scalability.

- Migrated from Gatsby.js to Next.js 15
- Built with React Server Components
- Refactored to TypeScript
- Improved Sanity CMS setup and editing experience
- Implemented Sanity Live API for real-time content updates

<br />
<br />
