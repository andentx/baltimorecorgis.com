## Description

This is a website for Baltimore Corgis, a community of Corgis, owners, and friends!
<br />
<br />
After starting with a Facebook page, then using a drag-and-drop website builder, the organizer of Baltimore Corgis decided to move to a more customized and performant solution for their website.
<br />
<br />
In February 2023, I built the first version of the new Baltimore Corgis website, using the existing/previous website's design. While implementing the existing features into a custom solution, I made the following improvements:

<br />

- Reduced page loading time by 75%
- Fine-tuned responsive resizing
- Improved accessibility
- Implemented custom fonts
- Made it easier to make changes in the future

<br />
<br />
